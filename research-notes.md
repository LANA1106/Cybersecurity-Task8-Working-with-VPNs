**Privacy Benefits:**
- **Website Tracking**: Prevents IP-based tracking and profiling
- **Geolocation**: Hides true geographic location
- **Government Surveillance**: Complicates mass surveillance efforts
- **Corporate Tracking**: Prevents workplace monitoring of personal browsing

**Limitations:**
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Unique browser characteristics still trackable
- **DNS Leaks**: Can reveal real location if not properly configured
- **Time Zone**: System time zone can reveal real location
- **Language Settings**: Browser language preferences indicate location

**Types of Kill Switches:**
- **Active Monitoring**: Continuously checks VPN status
- **Passive Protection**: Firewall rules prevent leaks
- **Application-Specific**: Only affects designated programs
- **Network-Wide**: Affects all network traffic

**Effectiveness Analysis:**
- **Response Time**: Critical factor in preventing data leaks
- **Reliability**: Must work even during system failures
